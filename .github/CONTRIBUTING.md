# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for contributing! CMSysBot was born as a small-size project for the CUSL, but we would like to take it to a next level by expanding it. Having the help of the community is essential for this task, so we hope you enjoy while working on the project!

Please, follow this guidelines while contributing. It helps for sorting the problems and features to add, and makes it easier for everyone to follow the development.

## How to get started

### Setup
First of all, make sure to [Read the Docs (still in development)](https://cmsysbot-telegram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest). It's one of the best references for understanding the inner works of the bot.

You should also __fork__ the project, and setup a __local environment__ for development (Follow the rules on the [README](https://github.com/oddworldng/cmsysbot-telegram/blob/master/README.md))

We also recommend to toy around with the bot before. Making small changes and breaking the code should also be a good way of learning.

### Development
Once you feel ready, start your development! Try to __keep the changes to a minimum__ (like aggresive code formatting) and just submit the necessary changes for your feature.

#### About Plugins:

We are also interested on adding new __plugins__ to the bot! If you find that there is a missing plugin that the bot should have by default, please submit it as a pull request too.


### Success!
When you're finished, commit and push to your forked repository, and submit a pull request. After being reviewed by the rest of the community, your changes will be ready to be included, or you may need to do some changes and push again.
